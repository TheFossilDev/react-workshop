# Welcome to SCA Club's React Workshop
## To get started, download Node.js, Visual Studio Code, and fork this repository.
We'll take the **starting files** and create a simple todo-list feature to display some of React's many features! You can also use the branch **completed files** to compare your result to ours!

Reminder: comments are **//** in javascript. It's helpful to take notes while you code!
